        		<h1>Mister Sri</h1>
			<p>Hi there! I’m Sri Vemuri. Welcome to my home on the internet. If you’re looking to collaborate on a project with an experienced startup marketer, or you would simply fancy saying hey, email me: <a href="mailto:hey@mistersri.com" target="_blank">hey@mistersri.com</a>.</p>
			<h2>PERSONAL</h2>
			<p>My earliest memories are of sundaes and milkshakes as a child growing up in my mom’s ice cream parlor. I’ve kept life sweet since. After graduating from Cornell, I spent nearly a decade working closely with startups on marketing and growth (more on that below). In my spare time, I climb <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/8ii8d14kthtc1ie/IMG_6609-1%20copy.png" target="_blank">big boulders</a> and <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4e2t0efovjgt0h2/DSCF3523.png" target="_blank">steep cliffs</a>. I’m fascinated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_root_bridges" target="_blank">bridges</a>, and <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/07/02/project-twins-unusual-words/" target="_blank">untranslateable words</a>. 19 countries later, I still enjoy exploring different countries, cultures, and cuisines. And find that there’s nothing more trance-like than watching bonito flakes <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EWbFWrh.gifv" target="_blank">dance</a> on a plate of takoyaki.</p>
			<h2>WORK</h2>
			<p><strong><u>HARVEST (2010-2017)</strong></u>: <a href="http://getHarvest.com" target="_blank">Harvest</a> is a B2B SaaS company that builds business tools beloved by freelancers, consultancies, and Fortune 500 companies in over 120 countries. I was the first marketing hire, reporting directly to co-founder Danny Wen. Over my 7 years at the company, the team grew Harvest from a few thousand paying customers to more than 50,000. We attracted customers through various channels and mediums.</p>
			<p>My role in this included: finding podcasts to advertise on, like NPR's Marketplace and 99% Invisible, and working with the hosts on creative placements; making a <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/crafting-a-slice-of-time" target="_blank">short film</a> which received over half a million views, and designing a website that captured the process behind making it; speaking and marketing at conferences, which included hosting our very own sold-out event called <a href="http://almanaclive.getharvest.com/" target="_blank">Almanac Live</a>; co-marketing with our integration partners Asana, Zendesk, Xero, and Basecamp; crafting high-quality guides; placing ad buys across various display and social media platforms; and, onboarding prospective customers through targeted email campaigns.</p>
			<p><strong><u>VARIOUS ROLES (2007-2010)</u></strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Maestro Market</strong>: My career in startups began with Maestro Market, an online marketplace for booking speakers at events, advised by serial-entrepreneur and Stanford professor, Steve Blank. We were very early stage, and I wore many hats – from product and business development, to marketing.</li>
				<li><strong>Teaspiller (acquired by Intuit)</strong>: I consulted with Teaspiller, an online platform that connected taxpayers with accountants to complete and file taxes. The work focused on achieving product-market fit, and communicating the value proposition. It was later acquired by Intuit and integrated into their TurboTax platform.</li>
				<li><strong>Pro-bono</strong>: I’ve worked with Peruvian farmers to promote activities like beekeeping to tourists en route to Machu Picchu, developed a slogan for a Japanese relief group in response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and helped couples brainstorm their wedding hashtags.</li>
