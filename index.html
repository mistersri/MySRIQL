        		<h1>Mister Sri</h1>
			<p>Hi there! I’m Sri Vemuri. Welcome to my home on the internet. If you’re looking to collaborate on a project with an experienced startup marketer, or you would simply like to get in touch, email me: <a href="mailto:hey@mistersri.com" target="_blank">hey@mistersri.com</a>.</p>
			<h2>PERSONAL</h2>
			<p>My earliest memories are of sundaes and milkshakes as a child growing up in my mom’s ice cream parlor. I’ve kept life sweet since. After graduating from Cornell, I spent nearly a decade working closely with startups on marketing and growth (more on that below). In my spare time, I climb big boulders and steep cliffs. I’m fascinated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_root_bridges
" target="_blank">bridges</a>, and <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/07/02/project-twins-unusual-words/" target="_blank">untranslateable words</a>. 19 countries later, I still enjoy exploring different countries, cultures, and cuisines. And find that there’s nothing more trance-like than watching bonito flakes <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EWbFWrh.gifv" target="_blank">dance</a> on a plate of takoyaki.</p>
			<h2>WORK</h2>
			<p><strong><u>HARVEST (2010-2017)</strong></u>: <a href="http://getHarvest.com" target="_blank">Harvest</a> is a B2B SaaS company that builds business tools beloved by freelancers, consultancies, and Fortune 500 companies in over 120 countries. I was the first marketing hire, reporting directly to co-founder Danny Wen. Over my 7 years at the company, the team grew Harvest from a few thousand paying customers to more than 50,000. We attracted customers through various mediums. Here’s just a few:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Short Film</strong>: Many of Harvest’s customers are creative agencies. We wanted to showcase a successful engagement between a fictious agency and their client, through a creative medium that would resonate: <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/crafting-a-slice-of-time" target="_blank">a short film</a>, and a page that captured the process behind making it. The film received nearly half a million views, garnered praise from creatives and <a href="https://twitter.com/davegreiner/status/359829972350799872" target="_blank">SaaS</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/wistia/status/352488099256860672" target="_blank">companies</a>, and received an <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/crafting-a-slice-of-time" target="_blank">honorable mention</a>.</li>
				<li><strong>Podcasts</strong>: We advertised on many podcasts, from NPR to <a href="https://twitter.com/drewish/status/679530646746734592" target="_blank">99% Invisible</a>. I always offered our product for free to hosts. They would often use it, and give a testimonial more powerful than any words I could ever write.</li>
				<li><strong>Conferences</strong>: While we had a presence at several conferences and meetups, we felt there was a lack of content available for our power users: agency owners and project managers. So we decided to host our own conference called <a href="http://almanaclive.getharvest.com/" target="_blank">Almanac Live</a>. I built and marketed the sold out event from scratch, which included defining the content, sourcing the speakers, and handling the logistics.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There were many other projects, like launching and co-marketing our integrations with other SaaS companies that included <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/blog/2013/08/harvest-time-tracking-in-asana/" target="_blank">Asana</a>, Zendesk, and Trello. I also managed our AdWords team, sourced and placed ad buys across display and social media, onboarded prospective customers through email, and more.</p>
			<p><strong><u>VARIOUS ROLES (2007-2010)</u></strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Maestro Market</strong>: My career in startups began with Maestro Market, an online marketplace for booking speakers at events, advised by serial-entrepreneur and Stanford professor, Steve Blank. We were very early stage, and I wore many hats – from product and business developement, to marketing.</li>
				<li><strong>Teaspiller (acquired by Intuit)</strong>: I consulted with Teaspiller, an online platform that connected taxpayers with accountants to complete and file taxes. The work focused on achieving product-market fit, and communicating the value proposition. It was later acquired by Intuit and integrated into their TurboTax platform.</li>
				<li><strong>Pro-bono</strong>: I’ve worked with Peruvian farmers to promote activities like beekeeping to tourists en route to Machu Picchu, developed a slogan for a Japanese relief group in response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and helped couples brainstorm their wedding hashtags.</li>
