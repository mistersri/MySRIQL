        		<h1>Mister Sri</h1>
			<p>Hi there! I’m Sri Vemuri. Welcome to my home on the internet. If you’re looking to collaborate on a project with an experienced startup marketer, or simply fancy saying hey, email me: <a href="mailto:hey@mistersri.com" target="_blank">hey@mistersri.com</a>.</p>
<h2>PERSONAL</h2>
			<p>My earliest memories are of sundaes and milkshakes as a child growing up in my mom’s ice cream parlor. I’ve kept life sweet since. After graduating from Cornell, I spent nearly a decade working closely with startups on marketing and growth (more on that below). In my spare time, I climb big boulders and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/f9lgh8320dy51xd/DSCF3523.jpg?dl=0" target="_blank">steep cliffs</a>. I’m fascinated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_root_bridges" target="_blank">bridges</a>, and <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/07/02/project-twins-unusual-words/" target="_blank">untranslateable words</a>. 19 countries later, I still enjoy exploring different countries, cultures, and cuisines. And find that there’s nothing more trance-like than watching bonito flakes <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EWbFWrh.gifv" target="_blank">dance</a> on a plate of takoyaki.</p>
			<h2>WORK</h2>
      <p><strong><u>INVISION (2017–Present)</strong></u>:<a href="http://invisionapp.com" target="_blank">InVision</a> supercharges design teams with design, prototyping, and collaboration tools. More than 5 million people are on the InVision platform from design-forward companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Lyft (including 80% of the Fortune 100). As a product marketing consultant, I was deeply integrated into the product marketing team, working cross-functionally across their 700+ employee organization to lead product marketing launches and support product adoption efforts.</p>
			<ul>
			 	<li>Define and execute go-to market strategy for InVision mobile apps to promote Freehand and Studio (Product Hunt #5, Apple App Store feature, 50 to 1.8K positive reviews).</li>
				<li>Increase mobile adoption with targeted emails and in-app messaging (highest engagement across all in-app campaigns).</li>
			 	<li>Develop positioning and messaging for major update to Cloud platform (2 years in the making, and the chief money maker), including enablement of customer-facing teams to support new pricing model.</li>
			</ul>
      <p><strong><u>HARVEST (2010-2017)</strong></u>:<a href="http://getHarvest.com" target="_blank">Harvest</a> is a B2B SaaS company that builds business tools beloved by freelancers, consultancies, and Fortune 500 companies in over 120 countries.</p>
		  	<ul>
				<li><a href="http://getHarvest.com" target="_blank">Harvest</a> is a B2B SaaS company that builds business tools beloved by freelancers, consultancies, and Fortune 500 companies in over 120 countries. I was the first marketing hire, reporting to the CEO, and responsible for all aspects of the funnel – from awareness to acquisition. Over 7 years we grew Harvest from a few thousand paying customers to more than 50,000.</li>
		  		<li>Partnered with Asana, Atlassian, Zendesk, and Xero to launch deep integrations key to growth. Optimized onboarding flows by analyzing workflow and user feedback.</li>
      				<li>Led a 7-figure advertising budget to raise awareness and acquisition across SEM, podcasts, radio, podcasts, print, conferences, and more.</li>
      				<li>Supported branding efforts that included a short film praised by customers and founders. Spearheaded the making of a <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/crafting-a-slice-of-time" target="_blank">behind-the-scenes</a> page to tell the story behind the camera (featured by Awwwards).</li>
			</ul>
				<p><strong><u>VARIOUS ROLES (2007-2010)</u></strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Maestro Market</strong>: My career in startups began with Maestro Market, an online marketplace for booking speakers at events, advised by serial-entrepreneur and Stanford professor, Steve Blank. We were very early stage, and I wore many hats – from product and business development, to marketing.</li>
				<li><strong>Teaspiller (acquired by Intuit)</strong>: I consulted with Teaspiller, an online platform that connected taxpayers with accountants to complete and file taxes. The work focused on achieving product-market fit, and communicating the value proposition. It was later acquired by Intuit and integrated into their TurboTax platform.</li>
				<li><strong>Pro-bono</strong>: I’ve worked with Peruvian farmers to promote activities like beekeeping to tourists en route to Machu Picchu, launched a campaign that raised $10,000 in 10 days for charity, developed a slogan for a Japanese relief group in response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and helped couples wed with the perfect hashtag.</li>
