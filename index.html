        		<h1>Mister Sri</h1>
			<p>Hi there! I'm Sri Vemuri. Welcome to my home on the internet.</p>
			<h2>PERSONAL</h2>
			<p>My earliest memories are of sundaes and milkshakes as a child growing up in my mom's ice cream parlor. I've kept life sweet since. After graduating from Cornell, I spent nearly a decade working closely with startups on marketing and growth (more on that below). In my spare time, I climb big boulders and steep cliffs. I'm fascinated by bridges, and untranslatable words. 19 countries later, I still enjoy exploring different countries, cultures, and cuisines. And find that there's nothing more trance-like than watching bonito flakes dance on a plate of takoyaki.</p>
			<h2>WORK</h2>

			<p><strong><u>HARVEST (2010-2017)</strong></u>: Harvest is a B2B SaaS company that builds business tools beloved by freelancers, consultancies, and Fortune 500 companies in over 120 countries. I was the first marketing hire, reporting and collaborating directly with co-founder Danny Wen. Over my 7 years at the company, the team grew Harvest from a few thousand paying customers to more than 50,000.</p>
			<p>We attracted creatives through various mediums. Here's just a few:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Short Film</strong>: Many of Harvest's customers are creative agencies. We wanted to showcase a successful engagement between a fictious agency that used Harvest and their client, through a creative medium that would resonate: a short film, and a page that captured the process behind making it. The film received nearly half a million views, garnered praise from creatives and SaaS founders, and received an honorable mention by Awwards.</li>
				<p.minor></p.minor>
				<li><strong>Podcasts</strong>: We advertised on many podcasts, from NPR to 99% Invisible. I always offered our product for free to hosts. They would often use it, and give a testimonial more powerful than any words I could ever write.</li>
				<li><strong>Conferences</strong>: While we had a presence at several conferences and meet ups, we felt there was a lack of content available for our power users: agency owners and project managers. So we decided to host our own conference called Almanac Live. I built and marketed the sold out event from scratch, which included defining the content, sourcing the speakers, and handling the logistics.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There were many other projects, like launching and co-marketing our integrations with other SaaS companies that included Asana, Zendesk, and Trello. Managed our AdWords team, sourced and placed ad buys across display and social media, onboarded prospective customers through email, and more.</p>
			<p><strong><u>VARIOUS ROLES (2008-2010)</u></strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Maestro Market</strong>: My career in startups began with Maestro Market, an online marketplace for booking speakers at events, advised by Steve Blank. We were very early stage, and I wore many hats - from product to marketing to biz dev.</li>
				<li><strong>Teaspiller (acquired by Intuit)</strong>: I consulted with Teaspiller, an online platform that connected taxpayers with accountants to complete and file taxes. The work focused on achieving product-market fit, and communicating the value proposition.</li>
				<li><strong>Pro-bono</strong>: I've worked with Peruvian farmers to create and market their activities on the farm to tourists en route to Machu Picchu, developed a slogan for a Japanese relief group in response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and helped couples brainstorm their wedding hashtags.</li>
			</ul>
